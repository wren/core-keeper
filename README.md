# What is this for

This is a way to keep mods synced between the server and clients for the game [Core Keeper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/).

## Install

Basically, you just need to:

1. download this repo, and
2. copy the two directories to the correct place on your system.

Downloading the repo can be done via your preferred git interface (`git clone https://github.com/wren/core-keeper.git`
or whatever), or via Github's zip functionality (click on green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP") if you prefer a
more manual approach.

Either way, once the files are on your system, see below for where to put them (it's different for Linux and Windows).

### Linux (including Steam Deck)

For the Steam Deck, you can copy the files via a flash drive, but that can very tedious. And you'll have to redo the
process every time the config is updated.

#### Auto-magic way

If you're comfortable with using a terminal and git, I recommend setting up your Steamdeck for SSH, then just running
`git pull` any time you need to update.

[This](https://shendrick.net/Gaming/2022/05/30/sshonsteamdeck.html) is a great walkthrough of how to enable SSH on your
deck. Once you've done that, you can run a few commands to finish the setup:

```sh
ssh deck@steamdeck # or however you set it up
mkdir -p ~/repos/core-keeper
git clone https://github.com/wren/core-keeper.git ~/repos/core-keeper
ln -s ~/repos/core-keeper/mods ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Core\ Keeper/CoreKeeper_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods
ln -s ~/repos/core-keeper/config "$(find ~/.config/unity3d/Pugstorm/Core\ Keeper/Steam/* -maxdepth 0 -type d | head -1)/mods"
```

After that, this is all that's needed to update to the latest config:

```sh
ssh deck@steamdeck # or however you set it up
cd ~/repos/core-keeper
git pull origin main
```

#### Manual way

1. Download these files (either via git, or via zip)
2. Copy the contents of `mods` to `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Core\ Keeper/CoreKeeper_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods`
   > NOTE: you might have to create the `Mods` folder
3. Copy the contents of `config` to `~/.config/unity3d/Pugstorm/Core\ Keeper/Steam/{steam id}/mods`

   > NOTE: The `{steam id}` varies depending on your Steam ID. Just use the only directory in there that is a
   > string of numbers. Also, you might have to create the `mods` folder

4. Start the game and confirm that the main menu says something like (4 mods loaded)

### Windows

#### Auto-magic way

```sh
# Or wherever you want to keep your repos
git clone https://github.com/wren/core-keeper.git D:\repos\core-keeper
cd D:\repos\core-keeper
robocopy mods "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Core Keeper\CoreKeeper_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods" /mir
robocopy config "%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Pugstorm\Core Keeper\Steam\{steam id}\mods" /mir
```

Then, whenever there's an update:

```sh
cd D:\repos\core-keeper
git pull
```

#### Manual Way

1. Download these files (either via git, or via zip)
2. Copy the contents of `mods` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Core Keeper\CoreKeeper_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods`

   > NOTE: you might have to create the `Mods` folder

3. Copy the contents of `config` to `%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Pugstorm\Core Keeper\Steam\{steam id}\mods`

   > NOTE: The `{steam id}` varies depending on your Steam ID. Just use the only directory in there that is a
   > string of numbers. Also, you might have to create the `mods` folder

4. Start the game and confirm that the main menu says something like (4 mods loaded)

### Shared Server

This section is here to remind myself where these files go on the shared server. Also, this can be used if someone other than myself needs to update the server.

1. Download these files (either via git, or via zip)
2. Connect via ftp to the server (not sftp, as the server doesn't support it)

   > NOTE: You can find the credentials in the G-Portal admin panel

3. Upload the contents of each directory below

   - Contents of `mods` goes to `/CoreKeeperServer_Data/StreamingAssets/Mods`
   - Contents of `config` goes to `/DedicatedServer/mods`

   > NOTE:
   > It's ok to delete all server contents in these directories, and overwrite
   > with the files from the repo (there's no risk to the save files or anything)
